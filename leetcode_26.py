# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
#Approach: Two-Pointer Technique
# The problem can be solved efficiently using a two-pointer technique since the array is already sorted. it is used because:
        #In-Place Modification: The problem requires modifying the array in-place without using extra space. The two-pointer method allows us to overwrite duplicate elements with unique ones.
        #Efficient Traversal: Since the array is sorted, duplicates are adjacent. By comparing adjacent elements, we can identify unique elements in a single pass (O(n) time).
        #Track Unique Elements: One pointer (k) tracks the position where the next unique element should be placed, while the other (i) iterates through the array to find unique elements.
        #Simplicity and Order Preservation: The approach ensures unique elements are placed in the correct order (as they appear in the sorted array) with minimal operations.

    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        if not nums:                                                           # If array is empty, return 0
            return 0
        k = 1                                                                  # Initialize pointer for the position to place unique elements
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):                                          # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
            if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:                                         # If current element is different from the previous one, comparing adjacent elements
                nums[k] = nums[i]                                              # Place the unique element at index k
                k += 1                                                         # Increment k to point to the next position for a unique element
        return k

# üîë Full Approach ‚Äì Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
# Observation:
# The array is sorted, so duplicates are always next to each other.
# We can compare each element with its previous one to detect duplicates.

# Two-pointer technique:
# Use one pointer (i) to scan the array.
# Use another pointer (k) to keep track of the position where the next unique element should go.
# Algorithm:
# Start with k = 1 (since the first element is always unique).
# Iterate from index 1 to n-1:
# If nums[i] != nums[i-1] (a new unique value found):
# Place it at nums[k].
# Increment k.
# After the loop, k represents the count of unique elements.
# Return:
# Return k as the new length of the deduplicated array.
# Elements after index k-1 are irrelevant (ignored).

# ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
# Time: O(n) ‚Üí one pass through the array
# Space: O(1) ‚Üí in-place, no extra memory
