# üìù Flashcard Version (for revision)
# ‚ÄúUse two stacks: stack for values, minStack for current mins.
# On push: push val and min(val, last min). On pop: pop both. getMin = top of minStack.‚Äù

# üîë Full Approach ‚Äì Min Stack
# Problem Restatement:
# Implement a stack that, besides standard operations (push, pop, top), can return the minimum element in constant time (getMin).

# Observation:
# If we only use one stack, finding the min would require O(n) each time.
# To achieve O(1), we need to track the minimum at each step.

# Two-stack solution:
# Use a normal stack for all elements.
# Use a minStack where each entry keeps the minimum of the stack up to that point.
# Initialize minStack with +‚àû to handle the first push gracefully.

# Algorithm:
# push(val):
# Push val to stack.
# Push min(val, minStack[-1]) to minStack.
# pop():
# Pop from both stack and minStack.
# top():
# Return last element from stack.
# getMin():
# Return last element from minStack.
# Return:
# All operations run in O(1).

# ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity
# Time: O(1) for all operations.
# Space: O(n) for the two stacks.
