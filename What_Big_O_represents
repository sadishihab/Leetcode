👉 What Big-O Represents

Big-O notation describes how an algorithm scales as the input size n grows very large.
It focuses on the dominant term that grows fastest.
Constant factors don’t change the growth rate, they only scale the work up or down.

🔹 Example 1: Linear time
def f1(n):
    for i in range(n):
        print(i)

This does n operations → O(n)

def f2(n):
    for i in range(100*n):
        print(i)

This does 100*n operations → still O(n)

✅ The 100 is just a constant factor → doesn’t change the growth rate as n → ∞

🔹 Example 2: Quadratic vs Linear

O(n²) vs O(100n) → Even if n is small, O(n²) eventually grows much faster than O(100n).
That’s why Big-O ignores constants and focuses on the fastest-growing term.

🔹 Intuition

Big-O = “how the runtime grows as n grows very large”
Constant multipliers only stretch or shrink the runtime, but the shape of growth stays the same.

📌 Analogy:

Think of a race track:

O(n) = straight path
O(n²) = big hill

Multiplying by 10 is like adding a small slope → doesn’t change that the hill is still steeper than the straight path.

✅ Summary:

Big-O ignores constants because we care about how the algorithm grows with n, not the exact number of operations.


👉 Why base of a logarithm does not change the asymptotic complexity

🔹 The Formula:

log_a n = (log_b n) / (log_b a)

a = old base
b = new base
n = the number we are taking log of

Meaning: you can convert a logarithm from one base to another by dividing by a constant log_b a.

Step by Step

Suppose we have log base 2 of n (log_2 n).
Using the formula:

log_2 n = log_10 n / log_10 2
log_10 2 ≈ 0.301  # constant

So:
log_2 n ≈ 3.32 * log_10 n                   # just a constant factor

🔹 Why in Big-O it doesn’t matter

Big-O notation ignores constant factors.
O(3.32 * log_10 n) = O(log n)

Similarly: O(log_2 n) = O(log_10 n) = O(ln n)

✅ So the base of a logarithm does not change the asymptotic complexity.

Intuition
Whether you halve a list (log_2 n), divide by 10 (log_10 n), or divide by e (ln n), the number of steps grows very slowly compared to n.

The base only changes the scale by a constant, which Big-O ignores.
